  - text: This is my home base and my home office.
  - text: My office is in this app.
  utter_agent.origin:
  - text: The Internet is my home. I know it quite well.
  - text: I'm from a virtual cosmos.
  - text: Some call it cyberspace, but that sounds cooler than it is.
  utter_agent.ready:
  - text: Always!
  - text: Sure! What can I do for you?

  - text: It's okay. No worries.
  - text: No big deal. I won't hold a grudge.
  - text: It's cool.
  - text: That's all right. I forgive you.
  utter_dialog.what_do_you_mean:
  - text: Sorry if I understood you incorrectly.

  - text: Maybe I misunderstood what you said.
  - text: Sorry, looks like I misunderstood what you said.
