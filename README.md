# raha-chatbot
Raha is a simple chatbot based on RASA NLU and RASA Core. Raha composed of two parts. one of them is it's server and the other one is a simple android app. The server is written by Python and android app is written by React-Native. Raha was my major project when I was studying bachelor of science in computer science at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad and I develop it in 2019.
